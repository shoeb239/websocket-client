## Steps for testing

- Download and install the project from my GitHub: https://github.com/shoeb239/websocket-client
- Run the script (using my test account credentials from Piehost) with the command: `php artisan myClient`
- Await the response from the WebSocket server.
- To receive a response from the server, use this testing tool: https://piehost.com/websocket-tester?url=wss://s12218.nyc1.piesocket.com/v3/1?api_key=3hMVK8wsPgzHX9FxQ6VkJgw1g3mIt1UFhuwwhTJ7
- Sending any text to the server using this tool will display the message on the terminal.
